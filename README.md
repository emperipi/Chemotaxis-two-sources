The code is provided to facilitate replication of our results and to encourage further exploration.  
**Note:** The code was primarily developed for our research use — it may not be especially efficient, readable, or adhere to standard notations and conventions. Please read and understand the code before modifying it, as unexpected behavior may occur. These files are released in the spirit of the [CRAPL license](https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/).

## Contents

### Python Simulation Code

- `prw_2_grads.py`: Simulates cell trajectories in a two-source chemotaxis model and saves downsampled positions over time.
- `prw_2_grads_hist.py`: Runs multiple trajectory simulations, accumulates a 2D histogram of cell positions, and saves the spatial density.
- `prw_2_grads_steady_state.py`: Simulates trajectories, saving only the final positions and orientations after reaching steady state.
- `prw_2_grads_module.py`: Contains core functions for trajectory simulation, histogram generation, and chemotactic analysis.

### Jupyter Notebooks for Figure Generation

- `Figure 1.ipynb`: Generates the panels for Figure 1 in the paper.
- `Figure 2.ipynb`: Generates Figure 2 panels.
- `Figure 3.ipynb`: Generates Figure 3 panels.
- `Figure 4.ipynb`: Generates Figure 4 panels.
