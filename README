Supplementary code - Competing chemical gradients change chemotactic dynamics and cell distribution
Emiliano Perez Ipi√±a and Brian A. Camley


These codes are shared to allow replication of our results and further exploration. Our codes were not developed with the goal of being efficient or easy to read, nor do they follow standard notations and conventions. We cannot guarantee that they will work as predicted if you try to change things without understanding them. In this sense, they are released in the spirit of the CRAPL license.

The zip file includes:

 - Python simulation code used in the article:
  - "prw_2_grads.py": Simulates cell trajectories in a two-source chemotaxis model and saves downsampled positions over time.
  - "prw_2_grads_hist.py": Simulates multiple trajectories, accumulates a 2D histogram of cell positions, and saves the spatial density.
  - "prw_2_grads_steady_state.py": Simulates cell trajectories and saves only the final positions and orientations after reaching the steady-state.
  - "prw_2_grads_module.py": Contains core functions for trajectory simulation, histogram generation, and chemotactic analysis.

 - Jupyter notebooks to generate the paper figures: 
   - "Figure 1.ipynb": Generate paper's Fig. 1 panels.
   - "Figure 2.ipynb": Generate paper's Fig. 2 panels.
   - "Figure 3.ipynb": Generate paper's Fig. 3 panels.
   - "Figure 4.ipynb": Generate paper's Fig. 4 panels. 
  
    
Requirements:
 - All python code runs in python 3, specifically we used Python 3.9.5. 
 - To install all required packages run 'pip install -r requirement.txt'
